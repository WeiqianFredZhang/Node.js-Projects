# Cool Node.js Projects

#### Downloads
- I use [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to code in JS

#### IMPORTANT
- Those projects are public, but please don't republish them!

#### Programming on Discord.js
- Every program requires the Discord.js module. Type `npm install discord.js` in your Vscode terminal to download this module.
