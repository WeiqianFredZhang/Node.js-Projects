# Dependency Requirements #

1. `Constantly Changing Discord Status.js` requires => npm install discord.js

2. `Read from env File.js` requires => npm install dotenv

#### Side Notes
- .env files are useful to hide information from the outside world. When running Discord bots on Replit.it or Heroku.com for free, consider creating one.
- The "token" variable in the current .env file is blank. Add your own Discord bot token there.
